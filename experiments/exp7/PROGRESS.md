# Experiment 7 — design ledger

## 2026-10-04: scope authorized, design proposed

Michael requested "Do the analysis and plan the experiment" after considering
the matched-token size analysis, a sampling-mechanism experiment, and an
across-task forecast. Management took this as the first two, and he then
explicitly approved the descriptive matched-token scope. That analysis lives
under `analyses/matched-token/`; this package records the separate design.

Draft: `experiment-7-design.md`. No dials ruled yet. No generator build,
tokenizer/weight download, model load, sample or new outcome contact.

**Ruling D1 (proposed):** counterfactual answer pairs and a difference of
target emission under both prompts, rather than another covariate-only
residual — the pair contrast cancels prompt-invariant answer preference
algebraically. Cost if wrong: it can still measure input-sensitive shortcuts
and shared item difficulty; it cannot adjudicate resolution versus construction.
The design makes that limit part of every possible licence.

**Ruling D2 (proposed):** one cross-family outcome, both 1B predictors, four
task families and meaning-preserving shams — useful discrimination at about
one million sampled draws, with no automatic second-outcome rental.

The first draft was written before the concurrent matched-token comparisons
were computed. Its generation rules are proposals requiring an independent
oracle/coverage feasibility check, not claims about existing implementation.
Thresholds, strata, power and budget recommendations await Michael's ruling.

**Design self-review D3:** both gates must read the same eligible families;
otherwise selectivity in an excluded family could license a forecast
elsewhere. Eligibility uses outcome support and availability only. Constant
predictors stay with D=0, keeping the eligible set invariant under the
arm-swap null. Also accounted explicitly for the k=16 untrained twin:
128,000 additional draws, 1,152,000 new-item draws in total.
